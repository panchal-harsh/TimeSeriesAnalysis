timeseries data

trend
seasonality
noise irregularity

it can be
-stationary
 |
  - constant mean, variance, autocorelation 
-non-stationary

we assume data to be stationary if it Is not we need to convert to stationary

methods to know if its stationary
|
- ADF(augmented dickey fuller)
-

then we do differencing if series is non stationary or log transformation or sqrt transformation of box cox 



AR series (Auto regressor)  check pACF

MA  (Moving Average)  CHECK acf


AR process me k significant spikes in pacf and decay in acf 
and vice versa for MA


auto regressor take into account previous value of time steps and their weightage is linear to find out which time steps should be used we see pacf and only take significant timesteps 

in moving average we take into account error in prediction in previous time steps to see which time steps to use we use acf


in ARMA 
we use combination of both

In ARIMA we use combination of ARMA before differencing so we do not have to difference it already before giving to ARMA



BIC score and AIC Score

adf test-- null hypothesis --series is not stationary p<0.05 reject null hypothesis
kpss test--null hypothesis --series is stationary



used smoothning  techniques (it is used for visualizing and not forecasting) 

- 3 mean centering ]
                   ]- moving average of 3 or 5 values
- 5 mean centering ]


-2 mean smoothening 
-4 mean smoothening


it is difficult to do forecasting in mean centerd averagw because we do not have last value 
Trailing Moving Average
we have last value 

simple exponential smoothening
Double exponential smoothening 
Triple exponential smoothning







intern project 

we first ask users to tell us target variable and date columns then ask  date frequency and unit
now we need to filter data our model can handle onlys single time series data 
we ask user to enter categorical columns and then ask him to check and uncheck those columns 
if we checks a columns means he wants to keeps all values in that columns and i he unchecks we ask him which value do he want to keeps for example if columns country is checked we keep it as it is (we have for same date many sales value belonginging to different countries)
but if he unchecks we ask him which category in that column does he want to keep (he choose usa we remove all other country)

then now we HAVE TO AGGREGATE NUMERICAL VALUES both target and non target ones(if it has to be used as regressor variable)
we ask him to select numercical columns and afggregation type (mean etc)
