timeseries data

trend
seasonality
noise irregularity

it can be
-stationary
 |
  - constant mean, variance, autocorelation 
-non-stationary

we assume data to be stationary if it Is not we need to convert to stationary

methods to know if its stationary
|
- ADF(augmented dickey fuller)
-

then we do differencing if series is non stationary or log transformation or sqrt transformation of box cox 



AR series (Auto regressor)  check pACF

MA  (Moving Average)  CHECK acf


AR process me k significant spikes in pacf and decay in acf 
and vice versa for MA


auto regressor take into account previous value of time steps and their weightage is linear to find out which time steps should be used we see pacf and only take significant timesteps 

in moving average we take into account error in prediction in previous time steps to see which time steps to use we use acf


in ARMA 
we use combination of both

In ARIMA we use combination of ARMA before differencing so we do not have to difference it already before giving to ARMA



BIC score and AIC Score

adf test-- null hypothesis --series is not stationary p<0.05 reject null hypothesis
kpss test--null hypothesis --series is stationary



used smoothning  techniques (it is used for visualizing and not forecasting) 

- 3 mean centering ]
                   ]- moving average of 3 or 5 values
- 5 mean centering ]


-2 mean smoothening 
-4 mean smoothening


it is difficult to do forecasting in mean centerd averagw because we do not have last value 
Trailing Moving Average
we have last value 

simple exponential smoothening
Double exponential smoothening 
Triple exponential smoothning
